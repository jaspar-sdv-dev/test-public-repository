# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

To ensure the security of this project, if you discover a vulnerability or security issue, please report it using one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisory**
    - Please use the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/jaspar-sdv-dev/test-public-repository/security/advisories/new) feature to report any vulnerabilities.
    - Reports submitted via Security Advisories are not public and will be sent directly to the maintainers.

- **GitHub Issues**
    - If you are unable to use Security Advisories, you may create a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jaspar-sdv-dev/test-public-repository/issues/new/choose), but **do not include detailed information about the vulnerability in your initial report**. Instead, state that you wish to disclose a security issue, and relevant maintainers will follow up with you privately for further details.

## Disclosure Policy

- Please **do not publicly disclose details of a security vulnerability** or share the information with others until a fix has been released or you have received instructions from the maintainers.
- In particular, do not post any sensitive security information in public Issues or Pull Requests.

## Response Process

- We commit to acknowledging your report **within 3 business days**.
- We will investigate and respond as quickly as possible, keeping you informed of our progress and intended mitigation strategy.

## Thanks and Credit

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users secure. If you wish, we can publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure in our release notes (or respect your request for anonymity).
